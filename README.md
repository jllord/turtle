## Turtle
#### Code With Friends

### Introduction
Turtle represents an experiment in designing an interface that allows multiple users to simultaniously work in a shared visual programming environment. 

### Why LOGO?
- LOGO is highly visual
- LOGO has a relatively simple instruction set
- The "turtle" works as a great user metaphor
- Implementing a [streaming LOGO parser in Javascript](https://github.com/thisandagain/logo) was relatively simple (particularly thanks to some work by Joshua Bell)
- I wanted to create something that could represent some of my ideas around what would make learning to program a more engaging experience. As with most things I build, I chose to do this in a way that I could immediately relate to (ie: "design what you know"). LOGO was my first programming language as a child, and thus I have an personal understanding of it as my 7-year-old self.

### Run
```bash
node app.js
```
