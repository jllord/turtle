## Turtle
#### Code With Friends

### Introduction
Turtle represents an experiment in designing an interface that allows multiple users to simultaniously work in a shared visual programming environment. 

### Why LOGO?
- LOGO is highly visual
- LOGO has a relatively simple instruction set
- Implementing a LOGO parser in Javascript was relatively simple (particularly thanks to some work by Joshua Bell)
- I wanted to create something that could represent some of my ideas around what would make learning to program a more engaging experience. As with most things I build, I chose to do this in a way that I could immediately relate to (ie: "design what you know"). LOGO was my first programming language as a child, and thus I have an personal understanding of it's strenghs and weaknesses.

### What's next?
Turtle was written over the course of a few weekends, and thus, only represents the most bare of ambitions. My hope is continue to build divergent prototypes that represent improvements around various different aspects of programming with a slant towards education.
